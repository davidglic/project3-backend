# Cocktail App <br>
The Cocktail App is a fun application created by David Lewis and Pachel Pederson in June 2021 where users can browse and favorite delicious cocktails.
Using TheCocktailDB API our application allows users to search and pin over 600 cocktails. Our users are able to search by name, ingredient, first letter and they can even populate a random drink!
